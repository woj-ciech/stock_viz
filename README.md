- When clicking on the chart, link to google will be generated and displayed with the date range and company name. Something like https://www.google.com/search?q=immunomedics&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:9/11/2020,cd_max:9/17/2020. 3 days before and 3 days after given date. It is to check if there were no big events announced before price dropped/rose
